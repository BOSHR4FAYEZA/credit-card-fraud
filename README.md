Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning
# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using unsupervised learning and anomaly detection techniques.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
- The dataset contains transaction details labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
- The goal is to identify unusual transactions that may indicate fraud.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Features include transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables.
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraud cases compared to normal transactions.

---

## ðŸ§ª Techniques Used
- Dimensionality Reduction:  
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
- Anomaly Detection:  
  - Isolation Forest  
  - One-Class SVM  
- Visualization tools for data distribution and anomalies.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Results
- Successfully identified suspicious transactions with high accuracy.  
- Clear visualization of separation between normal and anomalous data points.

---

## ðŸ’» How to Use
- The main analysis is in the attached Jupyter/Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file).  
- Open and run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
